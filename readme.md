# Test Suite for the Unified Media Segmentation Model

A test suite for the Unified Media Segmentation Model that aims to provide a compact URL representation of arbitrary segmentations of multimedia documents.
The test suite contains gold standard reference outputs for the segmentation schemed implemented in [MegraS](https://github.com/lucaro/MeGraS).
It uses media assets from [Big Buck Bunny](https://peach.blender.org/) and [Sintel](https://durian.blender.org/).
All these assets have been released under Creative Commons by the [Blender Foundation](https://www.blender.org/).
